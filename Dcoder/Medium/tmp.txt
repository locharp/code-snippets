My code fails case #5 in "Which Century is it?"
It seems to be about a 'nd' ventury.
But I cannot figure out what's worng.
Any idea?
```
century = (int(input()) + 99) // 100
suffix = 'th'
if century % 10 == 1:
  suffix = 'st'
elif century % 10 == 2:
  suffix = 'nd'
elif century % 10 == 3:
  suffix = 'rd'
print(str(century) + suffix)
```
